= The simple PHP to Excel converter =

The code php-excel aims at being a *very* simple. Generating larger excel files in the PHP processor brings some heavy load to the system. Therefore the class itself should be as lightweight as possible.

This implies that I need to (and will) judge thoroughfully about every single adjustment or feature enhancement. The core class Excel_XML will _always_ deliver the most basic features.
